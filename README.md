# Refugees-Quiz
 
# Self-scoring Trivia
Pre-load your app with some questions and answers.
Test the user's wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!
Bonus:
Add time-based scoring
Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)
Allow users to compete against each other on a high-score board.

# Technical Requirements
Your app must:
- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy online, using Github Project pages.
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

# Necessary Deliverables
- A hosted copy of your game or app, built by you, hosted on Github Pages
  -  Your HTML/CSS should pass the HTML5 Validator and CSS Validator
- A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
  -  A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo
  -  A readme.md file, including
      * Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
      * At least 5 user stories.

# Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
- Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
- Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
- Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

# User Stories:  
  1. As a user, I should see the instructions of the game first, to know how to play it.
  2. As a user, I should be able to add my name, so it's clear that the result is mine.
  3. As a user, when I answer a question, I should receive a feed back, so I know if I answered the question correctly.
  4. As a user, when I push next, I should see the next question, so I can continue the quiz.
  5. As a user, when I finish the quiz, I should see an overall result, to know how I performed in this quiz.
  6. As a user, I should see a timer on the top of the quiz, to make sure I can finish on time.
  7. As a user, I should be able to compete against an another player, so I know who among us knows more about the subject.
  8. As a user, I should be able to have my results saved, even after I refresh the browser.
