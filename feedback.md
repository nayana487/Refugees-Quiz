 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **3: Excelling.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **3: Excelling.** You've definitely hit the requirements here, and pushed yourself by adding a timer and scoreboard.

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **2: Performing.** You have a fair bit of dead code in there. I wouldn't have that on a master branch. Consider, in the future, creating feature branches and not merging until you achieve functionality. Also, be more mindful of scope with your variables. It's considered bad practice to have global variables, if it can be avoided.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **2: Performing.** An easy win here would be to implement flexbox techniques to make the site responsive. Also, maybe add an arrow or something to show where the next question was appearing. It was hard for me to see at first.
